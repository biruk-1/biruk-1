ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Biruk
I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on React, React Native, Web Development, and UI/UX design. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong skill set in building user-friendly web applications and mobile solutions that solve real-world problems. I specialize in creating highly interactive user interfaces, managing complex state with libraries like Redux, and integrating APIs for dynamic content.

ðŸš€ What I've Worked On
My recent work spans across a variety of exciting projects where I've developed everything from fitness trackers to college matching platforms. Here are some highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Fitness Tracker App (React Native)
In this project, I created a fitness tracking app with features like BMI calculation, exercise recommendations, and food tracking. I worked on implementing BMI-based categories to suggest personalized workout and diet plans. I also integrated smooth navigation between different app sections and made the UI intuitive and accessible for all users.

ðŸ”¹ Competent Scholars (React & Django)
Iâ€™ve been building Competent Scholars, a platform designed to help students fill out their stats, discover matching colleges, and apply through the system. I worked on both the front-end (React) and back-end (Django), ensuring a seamless user experience, from finding colleges to submitting applications. My goal was to make the application process as smooth and personalized as possible for students.

ðŸ”¹ Customizable Sliders & Image Galleries (React)
I've spent a lot of time customizing carousels, image sliders, and pagination features to enhance the user experience. Whether it's displaying multiple images at once, offering smooth transitions, or making sure sliders are responsive, Iâ€™ve worked on refining these features to meet specific needs. I also customized these features for testimonials and project galleries, making sure they are visually appealing and user-friendly.

ðŸ”¹ Personalized Web Components
Iâ€™ve developed multiple React components such as custom navigation bars, carousels, and model lists, all built with a keen eye for aesthetics and usability. Iâ€™ve implemented custom CSS and React hooks to manage dynamic states and animations, ensuring the components work seamlessly across different devices.

ðŸ’» Technologies & Tools I Use
I enjoy working with a range of technologies, and Iâ€™m constantly learning new things. Some of my go-to tools and libraries include:

React / React Native
JavaScript (ES6+)
Node.js
Redux (for state management)
CSS / SCSS / Styled-components
Git & GitHub
Django (for backend development)
GitHub Actions (for automating tasks)
Shields.io (for badges)
ðŸŒŸ What Iâ€™m Passionate About
I am deeply passionate about making web applications accessible, responsive, and user-friendly. I take pride in crafting polished, intuitive interfaces and ensuring that users have a smooth experience when navigating through apps. Whether it's fine-tuning the smallest details or creating large-scale, dynamic components, I enjoy the challenge of continuously improving both the look and functionality of my projects.
